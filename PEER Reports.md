**PEER Reports**

- On shelf: 1998 #1 - 2007 #12
- [1998 **#2** - 1999 #2](https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/lee.2636719?holding=0tsc74qye7yr980u)
    - Continues _PEER report (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center)_
    - Continued by _PEER report (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center)_
        - So they changed the name for 1 year to _**Report (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center)**_, then changed it back?
            - Why have the name in parentheses without the PEER?
    - **Other Forms** way at the bottom says "Also issued online" but there is no link
        - If you go to the Catalog record, it has the URL _right there at the top!_ Why is it not in ScholarSearch?
    * **General Note** "Report for PEER-1999/02 lacks title"
        - What? Not true, but even if it did, why this noted when they don't list all the titles anyway, just "Holdings" by year/vol?
- [Berkley holding](https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/lee.2636719?holding=4pl0vib325zpt1oh)
    + Shows up with the above record as another holding
    + Links to the PEER Reports homepage with **ALL** reports available as PDFs
- [1999 #3 - 2007 #12](https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/lee.2798068?holding=adb1m8fg5rc303k6)
    + **Other Forms** says "Some reports also issued online"
        * Still no link to where...
    + This holding shows two other holdings
        * [Selected Reports](https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/lee.2798068?holding=smth2x9kboxh071c)
            - A "Book (Online)"
            - Big **Selected Reports** link goes to PEER homepage where they are **ALL** still available
        * [**sfx.lib.byu.edu](https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/lee.2798068?holding=2efflrxu12b3vpg4)
            - What does this even mean? Who knows what "sfx" is in the Holding tabs or a big link that says "Sfx.lib.byu.edu"?
            - Goes to the SFX page that incorrectly states we have it from 1999 to 2007 in print
            - Full Text Online _BYU Electronic Journals_
                + Despite the claim, it does forward to the Berkely PEER site, so they get access, just not from BYU.
        * Somehow misses the Berkely holding or the other two print holding (which should all be one anyway...)
- [1998 no.1](https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/lee.3461904?holding=cij34dt3djl6riwg)
    + ????
    + [A **separate** Berkley online holding](https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/lee.3461904?holding=px65g20dnc7gubfx)
